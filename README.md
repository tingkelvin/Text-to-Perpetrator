# Project Description

Text to Perpetrator: visualising suspect description (Team 15)

Area:  Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning

Client:  Thomas Rowntree

In the police force, a textual description of a perpetrator is sent to the officers via the computers in their police cars.  Often, the description is hidden in amongst the other information about the crime.  It is difficult for the officers to quickly glance at the screen and get mental picture of the perpetrator. 

The text is written by a human and is often transcribed from the 000 call; hence it is unstructured in nature.  However,  the  description  is  short,  direct,  and  much  simpler  than  say  the  description  of a character in a book. For example: 

<aside>
üí° ‚Äú.....  Desc: Caucasian Male, white shoes, blue jeans, black hoodie, brown backpack."

</aside>

`Note this will a mostly be a natural language processing project as opposed to an image generation project.  The system can start off simple with hard coded pattern matching rules or it gain complexity with machine learning or deep learning.`

The system doesn't need to be photo realistic.  For demonstration, the system could run on a web server such that the user can supply textual description in the GET request and get an image back.
