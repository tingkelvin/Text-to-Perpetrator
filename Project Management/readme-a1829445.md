# 1.Project role:

During two milestones, I was responsible for the machine part which includes data preprocessing, building architecture, testing and training, building flask application, building docker image and finally deploy to google cloud service .

# 2.Contributions:

1. Team-15/model/TransformerAppearanceClassifier.py
   This is the architecture of the machine learning model, where we utilise the pre-trained model RoBERTa for text classification tasks.
2. Team-15/NLP/utils.py
   This is the until script for the test, train, validate data-preprocessing and model initialisation function.
3. Team-15/NLP/train.py & test.py
   This is the training and testing script that with customized arguments:
   --input: Dataset Directory
   --dataset: Name of the dataset
   --epoch: Number of epochs
   --learning_rate: Learning rate
   --batch_size: Numbers of batches
   --train: training required
   --tensorboard: enable to log tensorboard
   --google_colab: enable to run on google colab
4. Team-15/NLP/modelDriver.ipynb
   The main driver script to run the model.
5. Team-15/NLP/deployment/flask/
   Contain the flask web application, trained model, dependencies, configuration and Dockerfile for deployment.

# 3.Average hours investigated to the project:

During the entire project development process, I put at least 25 hours of working time or more in this project every week.
